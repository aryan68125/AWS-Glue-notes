## AWS Glue
**Why AWS Glue?** <br>

**What is ETL/ELT?** <br>
We want to **E**xtract the data and **L**oad that data somewhere and that loaded data should be **T**ransformed as per requirments.
- Data engineer will pull data from the sources 
- Data engineer make sure that the data is in the form which can be used by the downstream services or application
- This is the part where ETL/ELT comes in and its designed and maintained by data engineer.
