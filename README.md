## AWS Glue
### **What is ETL/ELT?** <br>
We want to **E**xtract the data and **L**oad that data somewhere and that loaded data should be **T**ransformed as per requirments.
- Data engineer will pull data from the sources 
- Data engineer make sure that the data is in the form which can be used by the downstream services or application
- This is the part where ETL/ELT comes in and its designed and maintained by data engineer.


| Aspect                       | ETL                                         | ELT                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Order                        | **Extract → Transform → Load**              | **Extract → Load → Transform** |
| Where transformation happens | Before loading (external processing engine) | Inside the data warehouse      |
| Best for                     | Traditional data warehouses                 | Modern cloud data platforms    |
| Scalability                  | Limited by ETL server                       | Scales with warehouse compute  |

**ETL :** <br>
**Pros :** <br>
- Clean data before storage
- Strong governance
- Lower storage cost (no raw dump)

**cons :**<br>
- Less flexible
- Slower to adapt to new schema
- Doesn't scale well for massive data

**ELT :** <br>
**Pros :**
- Highly scalable
- Store raw data (future proof)
- Faster iteration
- Works well with analytics + ML

**Cons :**<br>
- Raw data storage costs
- Requires powerful warehouse

#### Points to remember : 
- ETL scaling is:
    - Vertical (bigger machine)
    - Operationally heavy
- ELT scaling is:
    - Horizontal (distributed warehouse engine)
    - Cloud-managed

#### Deep architectural comparison

| Property             | ETL                  | ELT                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Raw data retained    | Usually no           | Yes                              |
| Schema flexibility   | Low                  | High                             |
| Reprocessing ability | Hard                 | Easy                             |
| Scaling compute      | Hard                 | Elastic                          |
| Best for             | Structured reporting | Analytics + AI + experimentation |
| Change tolerance     | Low                  | High                             |

### **Why AWS Glue?** <br>
AWS glue is a combination of many components that are stiched together. It is a serverless data integration service.

It helps you:
- Discover data
- Catalog metadata
- Transform data
- Prepare data for analytics

### **What is Serverless?**
Serverless means that you don't need to manage the underlying infrastructure, scaling etc. you just have to run the service.

### AWS Glue components 
- Direct tools: 
    - Data Catalog
    - Crawler
    - Glue Data Brew
- Indirect tools:
    - S3
    - Athena
    - IAM
    - Lambda

**NOTE :** IAM is the most important component in AWS you cannot build anything without IAM in AWS because security is the most important thing. <br>
IAM is a security through which multiple components talk to each other.

**What is IAM ?** <br>
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling access to AWS services. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users and applications can access.
