## AWS Glue
### **What is ETL/ELT?** <br>
We want to **E**xtract the data and **L**oad that data somewhere and that loaded data should be **T**ransformed as per requirments.
- Data engineer will pull data from the sources 
- Data engineer make sure that the data is in the form which can be used by the downstream services or application
- This is the part where ETL/ELT comes in and its designed and maintained by data engineer.


| Aspect                       | ETL                                         | ELT                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Order                        | **Extract → Transform → Load**              | **Extract → Load → Transform** |
| Where transformation happens | Before loading (external processing engine) | Inside the data warehouse      |
| Best for                     | Traditional data warehouses                 | Modern cloud data platforms    |
| Scalability                  | Limited by ETL server                       | Scales with warehouse compute  |

**ETL :** <br>
**Pros :** <br>
- Clean data before storage
- Strong governance
- Lower storage cost (no raw dump)

**cons :**<br>
- Less flexible
- Slower to adapt to new schema
- Doesn't scale well for massive data

**ELT :** <br>
**Pros :**
- Highly scalable
- Store raw data (future proof)
- Faster iteration
- Works well with analytics + ML

**Cons :**<br>
- Raw data storage costs
- Requires powerful warehouse

#### Points to remember : 
- ETL scaling is:
    - Vertical (bigger machine)
    - Operationally heavy
- ELT scaling is:
    - Horizontal (distributed warehouse engine)
    - Cloud-managed

#### Deep architectural comparison

| Property             | ETL                  | ELT                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Raw data retained    | Usually no           | Yes                              |
| Schema flexibility   | Low                  | High                             |
| Reprocessing ability | Hard                 | Easy                             |
| Scaling compute      | Hard                 | Elastic                          |
| Best for             | Structured reporting | Analytics + AI + experimentation |
| Change tolerance     | Low                  | High                             |

### **Why AWS Glue?** <br>
AWS glue is a combination of many components that are stiched together. It is a serverless data integration service.

It helps you:
- Discover data
- Catalog metadata
- Transform data
- Prepare data for analytics

AWS glue docs : 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/what-is-glue.html

AWS glue pricing related details are here : 
https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/

### **What is Serverless?**
Serverless means that you don't need to manage the underlying infrastructure, scaling etc. you just have to run the service.

## AWS Glue components 
- Direct tools: 
    - Data Catalog
    - Crawler
    - Glue Data Brew
- Indirect tools:
    - S3
    - Athena
    - IAM
    - Lambda

**NOTE :** IAM is the most important component in AWS you cannot build anything without IAM in AWS because security is the most important thing. <br>
IAM is a security through which multiple components talk to each other.

**What is IAM ?** <br>
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling access to AWS services. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users and applications can access.
Docs link related to IAM in AWS docs : <br>
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/

**what is AWS S3?** <br>
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics <br>
- AWS S3 bucket means our data lake
- Bucket means object storage i.e I can upload anything
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html

**Points to remember :**
- When creating AWS S3 bucket make sure that you enable bucket versioning because when this is enabled then if you are getting a file with the same name and type then the s3 will not replace the file it will simply give the file a new name which is a good thing in this case.
- Always create folders when working with S3
- We should not work on file level in data egineering we should always work on folder level.

### AWS Glue Catalog
Suppose you a data stored in csv files and that csv file is stored in the S3 bucket and you want to query this data using SQL. <br>
Normally this is not possible because csv is just a text file how can someone query data using SQL stored in csv files. Csv files are not a structured data <br>
Whenever you use SQL to query data that data needs to be a structured data i.e rows and columns <br>
You may say that if you open a csv file in excel you can view it in rows and columns, but excel is a software that is built to render the data inside the csv file in rows and columns but that doesn't mean the data iself is stored in rows and columns to be able to call it a structured data. <br>
So here we will apply an abstraction layer and this abstraction layer will be applied by **Data Catalog**. <br>
The moment you apply the abstraction applied by the **Data Catalog** the csv files stored in S3 starts behaving like objects of the database. FYI catalogs are equivalent to database. **So whenever you go inside the AWS Glue service and under the section Data Catalog you create a new database that means you are creating a new catalog.**<br>
This catalog will register the metadata and schema of the files and will create an object in the catalog. <br>
**ADVANTAGE :**
- This AWS Glue catalog gives the devs the power to use their SQL skills to query the data stored in csv, parquete etc. files (a non structured data) in the same way they would have queried the objects of databases.
- Catalog is the backbone of all the queries that you do in Athena. 
- If catalog is not there you will not be able to query the data.

There are three things in Data Catalog: 
- External table
- CTAS managed
- CTAS external

Here are some references that you can use from the official docs <br> 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/components-overview.html#data-catalog-intro
Getting started with the AWS Glue Data Catalog <br>
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/start-data-catalog.html

### How to create databases in AWS Glue?
You can create a database in AWS Glue by going to the menue option named database under the Data Catalog section on the side panel provided by AWS. <br>
On top right corner you will find the Add database button press it and create your database <br>

### How to create tables in AWS Glue catalog?
There are two ways to create a table in catalog:
- Manual
- Through crawlers

#### External table
When you have the data in the datalake (S3 bucket) and you want to register the data in the data catalog. <br>
Table metadata lives in the catalog but the real data is stored in the S3 bucket which is managed by you. <br>
amazon athena docs link : <br>
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/

#### How to create External table using Athena.
External table is the same as externally managed tables that I read in databricks.

**STEP 1:** <br>
Go to athena query console > settings > set query result path <br>
NOTE : The source and destination should not be the same i.e you cannot give the same s3 bucket url where you have the csv files to save your athena query results, it must be different or else you will keep getting errors saying destination to store query results is not provided when you try to create the external table.

**STEP 2:** <br>
From the left side panel > select create > and from the create table from data source section > select S3 bucket data

**STEP 3:** <br>
You will be greeted with a page where you will have to set 
- The table name, table description
- Dataset : set the location to the csv file in the s3 bucket that you are trying to use to create an external table from.
- Add bulk column button to set the column names and their data types. Since I am creating an external managed table from a csv file I can set all the columns to be of string type because csv files are not a structured data and it stores data in form of strings itself saperated by comma.

**STEP 4:** <br>
Once you did all the above steps correctly you will see a query to create external table generated for you. Your query should look like this : 
```python
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `aws-glue-tutorial-aditya`.`uber_data_external_table` (
  `vendorid` string,
  `tpep_pickup_datetime` string,
  `tpep_dropoff_datetime` string,
  `passenger_count` string,
  `trip_distance` string,
  `pickup_longitude` string,
  `pickup_latitude` string,
  `ratecodeid` string,
  `store_and_fwd_flag` string,
  `dropoff_longitude` string,
  `dropoff_latitude` string,
  `payment_type` string,
  `fare_amount` string,
  `extra` string,
  `mta_tax` string,
  `tip_amount` string,
  `tolls_amount` string,
  `improvement_surcharge` string,
  `total_amount` string
) COMMENT "This table holds the data related to customer behaviour and ride metrics for all the taxis that work under uber fleet"
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.serde.ParquetHiveSerDe'
STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.MapredParquetInputFormat' OUTPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.MapredParquetOutputFormat'
