## AWS Glue
**Why AWS Glue?** <br>

### **What is ETL/ELT?** <br>
We want to **E**xtract the data and **L**oad that data somewhere and that loaded data should be **T**ransformed as per requirments.
- Data engineer will pull data from the sources 
- Data engineer make sure that the data is in the form which can be used by the downstream services or application
- This is the part where ETL/ELT comes in and its designed and maintained by data engineer.


| Aspect                       | ETL                                         | ELT                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Order                        | **Extract → Transform → Load**              | **Extract → Load → Transform** |
| Where transformation happens | Before loading (external processing engine) | Inside the data warehouse      |
| Best for                     | Traditional data warehouses                 | Modern cloud data platforms    |
| Scalability                  | Limited by ETL server                       | Scales with warehouse compute  |

**ETL :** <br>
**Pros :** <br>
- Clean data before storage
- Strong governance
- Lower storage cost (no raw dump)

**cons :**<br>
- Less flexible
- Slower to adapt to new schema
- Doesn't scale well for massive data

**ELT :** <br>
**Pros :**
- Highly scalable
- Store raw data (future proof)
- Faster iteration
- Works well with analytics + ML

**Cons :**<br>
- Raw data storage costs
- Requires powerful warehouse

#### Points to remember : 
- ETL scaling is:
    - Vertical (bigger machine)
    - Operationally heavy
- ELT scaling is:
    - Horizontal (distributed warehouse engine)
    - Cloud-managed

#### Deep architectural comparison

| Property             | ETL                  | ELT                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Raw data retained    | Usually no           | Yes                              |
| Schema flexibility   | Low                  | High                             |
| Reprocessing ability | Hard                 | Easy                             |
| Scaling compute      | Hard                 | Elastic                          |
| Best for             | Structured reporting | Analytics + AI + experimentation |
| Change tolerance     | Low                  | High                             |
